                    information environments are powered by enterprise portals to support operational operations,

                    </span>
                    Web portals are not the same as webpages. In terms of usefulness, they provide a completely
                    different experience. A Web portal is a website that serves as a central location for accessing
                    information on the Internet. As a result, a web portal gathers and shows data from a variety of
                    sources on a single platform. They not only serve as a "one-stop information destination," but they
                    also provide a uniform appearance and feel, as well as access control and processes for numerous
                    applications that would otherwise be managed independently. <br><br>

                    Overall, Online portals give users with a convenient, adaptable, and intuitive web interface via
                    which they may access information and services of interest. Web portals such as Yahoo, AOL, and MSN
                    are just a few examples.
